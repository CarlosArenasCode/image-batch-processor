## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct:
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them learn
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/image-batch-processor.git
   cd image-batch-processor
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks on all files (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Write your code
- Add or update tests
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Run Tests and Checks

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=image_batch_processor

# Run linting
flake8 .

# Check code formatting
black --check .

# Fix code formatting
black .

# Run type checking
mypy image_batch_processor/
```

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting (line length: 88 characters)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type hints where appropriate

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md if adding new features

### Example Docstring

```python
def resize_image(image_path: str, width: int, height: int) -> bool:
    """Resize an image to specified dimensions.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the input image file.
        width: Target width in pixels.
        height: Target height in pixels.
        
    Returns:
        True if successful, False otherwise.
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the image file doesn't exist.
        ValueError: If width or height are not positive integers.
    """
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use pytest for testing
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test file names should start with `test_`

### Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from image_batch_processor import some_function

def test_some_function():
    """Test description."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = "test_input"
    
    # Act
    result = some_function(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=image_batch_processor --cov-report=html
```

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat: add image rotation functionality"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in batch processing"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"

# Refactor
git commit -m "refactor: improve error handling in CLI"
```

### 2. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Create Pull Request
